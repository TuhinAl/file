what is docker? it is an ecosystem that helps us to containerize the application, docker ecosystem contains Docker Client, Docker Server, Docker Machine, Docker Images, Docker Hub, Docker Composes.

what is Docker Images: Image is a snapshot of filesystem that contains dependent libraries and configurations files.

  docker run = docker pull + docker start, when we write 'docker run IMAGE_NAME' in terminal, docker client receive the 'run IMAGE_NAME' commaint and ccheck that image in local cache, if not found in local cache then pull it from Docker Hub, cached it in 
    local registry, then make the container, distribute the recources (Network, bandwidth, RAM, Storage, CPU) and finally start as startup command. Docker image has two part, file system and startup command.

    ** to interact with docker container: docker run -it IMAGE_NAME sh
